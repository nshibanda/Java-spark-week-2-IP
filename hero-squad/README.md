## Description

This project is my week Two Java Spark IP about a Hero Squad Game

A Hero Squad game is an interactive game where players have the opportunity to recruit and assemble a team of superheroes to combat various challenges and enemies. The game revolves around the concept of creating a well-balanced team of superheroes, each with unique abilities and weaknesses, to overcome obstacles and accomplish missions.

In a Hero Squad game, players typically have the following objectives and gameplay elements:

Recruit Heroes: Players have the ability to select and recruit different heroes into their squad. Each hero possesses their own special powers, skills, and weaknesses. The players must strategically choose heroes with complementary abilities to form a strong and balanced team.

Squad Formation: Players need to strategically assign heroes to their squad, considering factors such as team synergy, tactical advantages, and mission requirements. The squad formation plays a crucial role in determining the overall effectiveness and success of the team.

Missions and Challenges: The game presents various missions, quests, or challenges that the Hero Squad must undertake. These missions can range from rescuing hostages, defeating supervillains, solving puzzles, or protecting the city from imminent threats. Players must navigate through different levels, face adversaries, and utilize their heroes' unique abilities to overcome obstacles and achieve the mission objectives.

Turn-Based Battles: Hero Squad games often incorporate turn-based combat mechanics. Players engage in battles with enemies or other opposing forces, taking turns to execute actions and abilities. The outcome of battles depends on factors such as hero abilities, strategy, and tactical decision-making.

Progression and Upgrades: As players advance through the game, they can earn experience points, currency, or other rewards. These can be used to level up heroes, unlock new abilities, acquire equipment or upgrades, and enhance the overall power and effectiveness of the Hero Squad.

Team Management and Strategy: Successful Hero Squad games require players to manage their team effectively, including optimizing hero selection, upgrading abilities, managing resources, and devising strategies to overcome different challenges. Players must consider the strengths and weaknesses of each hero and adapt their strategies accordingly.

Cooperative or Competitive Gameplay: Some Hero Squad games may offer cooperative gameplay options, allowing players to team up with friends or other players to tackle missions together. Alternatively, the game may feature competitive elements, such as PvP battles or leaderboards, where players can compete against each other to demonstrate the strength of their Hero Squads.

Overall, Hero Squad games provide an immersive and engaging experience, allowing players to immerse themselves in a world of superheroes, teamwork, and strategic decision-making. The game combines elements of role-playing, strategy, and action to create an exciting and dynamic gameplay experience.
